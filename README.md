# Weather Forecast Web Application

# Prerequisites

- Node v16; it is recommended to install Node with [nvm](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Bootstrap

- Clone this project

- Run the following commands inside the project folder:
  ```bash
  nvm install && nvm use
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

# Workflow

- To work on a new feature, checkout a new branch from the `main` branch on your local machine:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```

  - Branches' names should be in the form of `<prefix>/<functionality>`, for example `ft/login`. See more in the `Convention` section.

- Before committing, always reformat and check linting rules:
  
  ```bash
  npx prettier --write .
  npm run lint

  ```

- To push changes from that new branch to the repo for the first time:

  ```bash
  git push -u origin <branch-name>
  ```

  - `<branch-name>` here is the name of the respective branch on the Github repo, and it should be similar to the local branch name.

- After that you can just push changes simply with `git push`.

- When a feature is ready for merging, create a `pull request`.

- **NEVER PUSH TO THE MAIN BRANCH**

## Conventions

### Commits

- Commit messages should be in the form `<action> + <target>`, eg. _updated configs_
  - `<action>`: in past tense, eg. _added_, _updated_
  - `<target>`: files, packages, or features, eg. _side bar component_, _Bootstrap_, _assign task module_

### Naming

- Names should be in English

- Use meaningful names: they should describe what they represent, their roles, their functionalities, etc.

- Avoid arbitrary names: a, b, c, x1, x2, ...

- Names should be less than 5 words

- Careful with the use of some words representing a set of multiple objects: *list*, *set*, ...
	```javascript
	let userList = [...] // not readable
	let users = [...] // better
	```

- Avoid noise words: *the*, *a*, *an*, *data*, *info*, *manager*, *variable*, ...

- Variables and functions should be named in camel case, eg. _selectedStaffs_, _customHook_

- Constants should be named in snake case with all caps, eg. _API_KEY_

- Components and their respective files should be named with Pascal case, eg. _AddStaffModal_, _AddStaffModal.jsx_.

- Branches should be named in the form of `<prefix>/<functionality>`, for example `ft/login`. Some conventional prefixes:
    
    - ft: Working on a new feature
    - fix: Fixing errors or refactoring code
    - pkg: Adding packages
    - doc: Adding documentations

- TBA.

### Components

- The preferred way of writing components is functional components.

- It is highly recommended to use pre-installed components from libraries and UI kits rather than build one from scratch. This saves up tons of time.

- TBA.

### Other Clean Code Practices

- No hard coding

- Avoid magic numbers, assign them to constants or variables with comments instead

- No double negative conditions

- Avoid too much nesting

- TBA.

### Testing

- Unit tests should be made for each components.

- Testing can be done with
	```bash
	npm run test
	```
	or
	```bash
	npm run coverage
	```

- TBA.
